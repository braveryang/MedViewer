Medical Image segmentation using active shape models on high frequency ultrasound data. I cannot post the dataset for obvious reasons but you can look at my codes and use it for your needs. I also have a GUI over the entire algorithm.

You can find all the required libararies in the import functions I will provide proper documentation of the code line by line later. For now you can run the embedding_in_tk.py and follow the GUI alternatively you can look at toberuined.py for the code on ASM

Thank you
